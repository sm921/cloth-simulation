## ?. Ideas

### Marco Fratarcangeli

1. An avatar tries fitting in a virtual fitting room.

### AR posture detection

1. Create an avatar of a user by camera (with DL-model or body measurements) (one time)
2. Load images from camera and detect the posuture to move positions of 3d model of the avatar to render a cloth on it (for each frame)
